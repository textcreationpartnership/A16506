         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To conclude, witneſſe that famous Hiſtorie of <hi>Androdus</hi> the fugitiue ſeruant;<note place="margin">Aulus Gellius.</note> who by errour falling into a Lyons denne, which had a thorne in his foote; <hi>Androdus</hi> pulling it out, the Lyon nouriſhed him for a time with him; and when he eſcaped thence, being (taken for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and) caſt to a company of Lyons, where that Lyon alſo (being taken by hunters) was kept: The Lyon knowing <hi>Androdus</hi> his old Chyrurgion, would not ſuffer him to be deuoured, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both were ſet at libertie, and the Lyon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him euery where like a Dog, was pointed at by all men with this obſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Ecce leo hoſpes hominis, Ecce homo medicus leonis:</hi> Behold a Lyon the Hoſte of a man, and behold a man the Phyſition of a Lyon. Thus you ſee not only God, but alſo men and bruite beaſts, haue beene delighted with the duty of thankfulneſſe. To acknowledge therefore thoſe many fauours which I haue receiued, both
<pb facs="tcp:6901:4"/> from you all in generall, and from ſome in a more eſpeciall manner. For from you the learned Paſtour (I muſt confeſſe) I not only ſucked my firſt milke in the Vniuerſitie, but receiued my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and furtherance to be planted in this Citie, and (by a free election) in this place, wherein (by Gods gracious fauour) for theſe foure yeeres and vpwards, I haue happily continued. And from you my worthy and euer honoured friends (with whom I haue liued,) I haue obtained not onely a principall part of my liuelyhood for the preſent; but (by a moſt free and noble gift) a Paſtorall charge, wherein I may exerciſe (with much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) my miniſteriall office for the time to come. Nor can I here end, for from many other in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I haue not wanted priuate fauours, witneſſes of their pietie to God, and good will towards me. How then can I be ſilent and ſuffer my ſelfe to be iuſtly branded with the coale of Ingratitude? To preuent this, I haue aduentured to offer (as a Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well) theſe my weake meditations vnto you, which though they be farre vnable to ſatisfie your deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, yet may they remaine with you (when I am gone,) as a teſtimonie of my deſires. They are a New-yeeres gift (in reſpect of the time, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſubiect,) not too high for any, nor too baſe for the beſt, fitting, pleaſurable and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all, if you reade, and remember, and practiſe them with Conſcience. They are a plaine and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect plat-forme of the ſtate of a Chriſtian, ſhewing how we may walke, from the true knowledge of Chriſt (which is the foundation of all) to the true
<pb facs="tcp:6901:4"/> Vnion, and Communion with Chriſt and his Church; and in theſe to that heauenly newneſſe, in and by which we muſt all paſſe through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Labyrinths, and dangerous temptations of our ſpirituall enemies; from the old Iericho of this world, to that new Ieruſalem in the kingdome of heauen. And this is the ſumme of all that we can teach, or you can deſire to learne. Being therefore now (by Gods prouidence) to take my leaue of you, my laſt requeſt ſhall be (both to you and to God for you,) That not onely theſe meditations, but alſo all my poore endeauours may by Gods bleſſing, ſo remaine with you, that they may work in you all, ſuch a meaſure of this excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, this bleſſed Vnion, Communion and new creation, that you may haue peace, that true peace of Conſcience, and comfort of ſoule for euer; that the Lord of peace may giue you peace alwaies by all meanes,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.16.</note> and that the gracious preſence of God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the holy Ghoſt. may be with you, bleſſe, preſerue, and keepe you all in the kingdome of Grace, to the kingdome of Glory for euer.

            </p>
            <p>And laſt of all, the fruit of all, the pleaſant grapes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which are as a ſweete ſacrifice vnto God.

            </p>
            <p>Againe, in the ſecond part of my Text, the double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. There is a two-fold time of the yeere expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

And this in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6901:8"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> middle of the verſe: <hi>Olde things are paſt away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond the Spring, when euery thing doth bud forth in abundance,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.11, 12, 13.</note> when the flowers appeare on the earth, and the time of the ſinging of birds is come, when the voyce of the Turtle is heard in our land, when the fig-tree putteth forth her greene figges, and the vine with the tender grapes giue out their ſmell; when the earth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing worne out her old garments, beginneth to be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed anew with graſſe and flouriſhing greene hearbes, when all things change themſelues into a new eſtate. And this in the end of the verſe: <hi>Behold, all things are become new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of theſe in their order, and firſt of the firſt, the vineyard, in that of the vine-tree, and of the firſt thing I noted therein, the Branches, which are man and euery Chriſtian man.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6901:9"/> true alſo of the ignorance or knowledg of Chriſt in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: from the true knowledge of Chriſt there proceeds a loue of Chriſt (yea, a reciprocall loue, not only of thee to Chriſt, but of Chriſt to thee,) and from the ignorance of Chriſt, deſperation deſtroyeth the ſoule.</p>

            <p>And to reſolue this queſtion, wee muſt know that there is a two-fold <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, cognition or knowledge of God and of Chriſt. The firſt is a true, certaine, and perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and this is that by which a man doth truly, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perfectly, that is, not in part only, and aenigmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6901:12"/> or as in a glaſſe darkely, but in whole, and moſt cleare manner, know God, and Chriſt as hee is God and man in one perſon.<note place="margin">Zanchius in <hi>1.</hi> Ioh. cap. <hi>2.3.</hi> v.</note> And with this perfect and abſolute knowledge in this world, onely Chriſt as he was man did know God. But with this knowledge (in this life) Chriſtians do not know God, neither can they know him thus, till the life to come. Nay, with this full, perfect, and abſolute knowledge, Chriſt is not knowne of vs, eſpecially as he is God, or as vnited God and man in one perſon, in that his moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and admirable vnion. For in this life we are not fully vnited to Chriſt our head, neither ſhall be till we be glorified with him in heauen. And therefore in this life that of the Apoſtle may be truely verified both of the knowledge of God and of Chriſt, <hi>For now we ſee through a glaſſe, darkely; but then face to face: now I know in part, but then ſhall I know euen as alſo I am knowne,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, therefore there is an imperfect knowledge, but yet it is true and certaine, yea, and euident alſo, though not with the euidence of ſence and naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet with the euidence of faith and ſpirituall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And this is that by which all the elect being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by the Spirit of God, doe in this life know and acknowledge God and Chriſt. That of the Prophet is truely verified in this: <hi>They ſhall know me, from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord, for I will forgiue their iniquities, and J will remember their ſinne no more. Jeremiah</hi> 31.34.</p>

               </note>And as there are two ſorts of men in the Church who profeſſe Chriſt: The firſt of Hypocrites, who do brag in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the knowledge of Chriſt, and in words doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him to be true God, and true man, and a Sauiour, but in their deeds they deny him, alwaies liuing in their ſins, and neuer repenting; yea, howſoeuer they profeſſe an obedience to the Law of God, performing (or rather ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming outwardly to performe) ſome of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet in their minds and hearts they loue not the

               <note place="margin">Iam. 2.20. Mat. 13.4, 5, 6</note> a temporary faith by our Sauiour, and an hypocritical faith by Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> becauſe it is a knowledge without practiſe, a faith not working by loue, like that of the <hi>ſeruant who knowes his maſters will, but doth it not,</hi> Luk. 12, 47: or that of the Gentiles who <hi>did know God, but did not glorifie him as God,</hi> Rom. 1.21.

If you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint Cedar or Iuniper wood with oyle, no canker will eate it. So if you beſtow the oyle of induſtry vpon your knowledge, the worme of ignorance cannot hurt it. But as a ſtanding poole will ſooneſt putrifie, or be dryed vp if it want a ſpring to feede it; ſo if your knowledge ſtand at a ſtay, or be not ſupplyed by a daily labour of increaſe, it will quickly be dryed vp, wither as the graſſe on the houſe top, and come to nothing before you be aware. Therefore as in the parable of the talents they that had increaſed were rewarded, and <hi>the vnprofitable ſeruant caſt into vtter darkeneſſe, Matth.</hi> 25.30.

               </gap> conſequence, the whole man corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; So <hi>Democritus, Leucippus,</hi> and a ſort of Philoſophers called Epicures. The ſecond did teach that man was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> incorporeall, that is, all ſoule; for they would haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the ſoule of man to pertaine to the ſubſtance and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6901:27"/> eſſence of man, and his body to bee but an inſtrument to the ſoule, as the ſhip is to the pilot. So <hi>Plato</hi> and other Stoicall of philoſophers like himſelfe. The third ſort did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that man was compoſed of both as of his eſſentiall parts, of a ſoule as of his formall, and of a body as his materiall cauſe, and both required to make vp the eſſence and being of man. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the Peri-pateticks his followers. And this is moſt agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for when God made the body of man of the earth, he made his ſoule from heauen, and vniting them both together in a wonderfull manner,<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.14.15.</note> man became a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, or a liuing ſoule, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. Not that he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a liuing ſoule, for he is a liuing body as well as as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſoule, (the body liuing by the ſoule,) but hee hath his denomination in that place from the better part which is his ſoule.

               </note> is my Text. So that hence we may learne that there is an admirable vnion and Communion betweene Chriſt and his Church, betweene our Sauiour and euery faithfull ſoule. And to vnderſtand this, we muſt know that there is a threefold Vnion and Communion of Chriſt with vs. The firſt in nature: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in grace, and the third in glory. The firſt is that Hypoſtaticall or perſonall Vnion of our humane nature with the divine, of which Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1.14. <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt vs, and we saw the glory thereof, as the glory of the onely begotten Sonne of the Father, full of grace and truth.</hi> The Word, that is, the Divinitie of Chriſt, was made fleſh, that is, did take vpon him our humane nature; he tooke on him the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. and did dwell <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in vs, (as it is in the Originall) that is, in our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi> S. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and others obſerue. And ſo they vſed this place againſt thoſe heretickes who affirmed that the Word was conuerted into the fleſh; for if he dwelt in the fleſh, that is, in our humane nature, then he remained ſtill what he was, and therefore could not bee conuerted into the fleſh, as they falſly imagined. This expoſition is true in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though it doth not fully explicate this vnion of Chriſt with vs; for Chriſt doth not onely dwell in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a man in his manſion houſe, but is vnited vnto our nature, as the ſoule to the body, yea after a farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and wonderfull manner. The two natures of Chriſt, the divine and humane, being vnited, make one perſon, ſaith <hi>Damaſcen;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Damaſc. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> there is one Chriſt, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6901:28"/> of the Diuinity into the fleſh, but by aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of humanity into his Godhead; one altogether not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of eſſence, but by vnity of perſon, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi>
               <note place="margin">Athanaſius in Symb.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes. And by this admirable vnion, Chriſt the eternall Word of his Father did aſſume in moſt neere maner vnto himſelfe our whole humane nature, without any conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, confuſion, alteration, or ſeparation as the <hi>Chalcedon</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chalcedon. Symb.</note> creede doth teſtifie, and that, (as <hi>Damaſcen</hi> addeth) the proprieties of both natures being ſafe. Therefore the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did affirme, that the myſtery osthis vnion was <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiliter ſingulare, &amp; ſingulariter mirabile,</hi> Wonderfully ſingular, and ſingularly wonderfull; it is that great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of godlineſſe, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Of which there is no example in nature, which <gap reason="foreign">

To conclude, this vnion is not imaginary onely, but true and reall (though ſupernaturall,) and the foundation of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall with Chriſt, both in grace and glory depends vpon it. For had he not taken our nature vpon him, and ſo freely marryed himſelfe vnto vs,<note place="margin">Hoſh. 2.19.</note> we could neuer haue beene vnited to him. But Chriſt vniting himſelfe to vs in nature, (and God accepting vs as iuſt and righteous for his merits,) we are vnited to him in grace, which is the ſecond vnion betweene Chriſt and vs.<note place="margin">The ſecond vnion is of our perſons with Chriſt here. <hi>Zanchias in comment. in</hi> Epheſ Gen. 2.24.</note> And this is the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our perſons, of our whole man both ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, vnto the whole perſon of Chriſt, God and man, by the excellent bond of our ſpirituall marriage, in which Chriſt hath vnited vs vnto himſelfe; as the whole perſon of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> was ioyned in wedlocke to the whole perſon of <hi>Eue,</hi> ſo are we to our heauenly bridegroome.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third vnion, is our union with Chriſt in glory, in the kingdome of heauen,<note place="margin">A vnion with Chriſt in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> by which we ſhall enioy the preſence of our Sauiour, yea wee ſhall haue vnion with God and his Angels, and be filled with abundance of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and happineſſe for euermore: of this our Sauiour ſpeakes, <hi>John</hi> 14.3. <hi>J goe to prepare a place for you, and if I goe to prepare a place for you, I will come againe, and receiue you vnto my ſelfe, that where J am, there may you bee alſo.</hi> And for this vnion, our Sauiour prayeth to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt giuen me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt giuen me: for thou louedſt mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world.</hi> And this vnion the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle did ſo earneſtly long after. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Ideſire to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> Neither is it to be doubted, but that our Sauiour in the firſt vnion, the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our nature, was willing to praemonſtrate the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, our vnion in grace, and in the ſecond to manifeſt the third, that by that vnion which we enioy in preſent, we might bee confirmed in the hope of that which wee ſhall enioy hereafter.<note place="margin">Amandus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntag.</note> The firſt vnion is referred to the ſecond, and the ſecond to the third, as nature is ordinated to grace, and grace to glory. The firſt vnion is the cauſe of the ſecond, and the ſecond is the cauſe of the third. For we cannot be vnited to Chriſt in glory in the life to come, except we be ingrafted into him in this life by grace; but we could not haue been vnited to him in grace, except Chriſt had vnited himſelfe to vs in nature, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our nature upon him: Whoſoeuer therefore will be vnited to Chriſt in glory, it is neceſſary that he be firſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to him in grace; and whoſoeuer is vnited in grace, it is neceſſary that he ſhould haue bin vnited to him in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus you haue a briefe view of our threefold vnion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6901:29"/> with Chriſt. But it is the ſecond of theſe, our vnion with Chriſt in grace, of which I am now to ſpeake.</p>
            <p>And therefore to illuſtrate this a little further, I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you it was a vnion of our perſons, ſoule and body, with the perſon of Chriſt both God and Man: For as in the firſt vnion, the vnion of Chriſt with our nature, the whole perſon of the Sonne of God did aſſume into the vnitie of himſelfe the whole man, that is, his whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, not the body alone, nor the ſoule alone, but both together; So is it when Chriſt is vnited to a Chriſtian, he is vnited to the whole man, both ſoule and body, as a Chriſtian is vnited to the whole Chriſt, both God and Man. Therefore the Apoſtle doth not onely witneſſe, that he which is ioyned to the Lord is <hi>one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> but that <hi>our bodies are the members of Chriſt;</hi> in the 15 verſe of the ſame Chapter; <hi>Yea, wee which are many, are one body in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 12.5. <hi>So that Chriſt is vnited both to our ſoules and bodies.</hi> And thus are we vnited vnto whole Chriſt.

               <hi>wee are members of his body, yea, of his fleſh, and of his bones;</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) Epheſ. 5.30.

That is, that thing by which we are receiued into Communion with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> interpreteth it: yea, by this wee

               </gap>d; and a true and reall vnion, becauſe they are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited into one true fleſh, and are alwayes truely one fleſh; But how? In reſpect of that coniugall bond in which they are vnited by the ordinance of God. And this the Apoſtle applyeth to that ſpirituall vnion betweene Chriſt and his Church. This is a great myſterie (ſaith he) but I ſpeake concerning Chriſt and the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.32. But this vnion of Chriſt with vs is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, for Chriſt doth not onely communicate vnto vs all needfull graces, as the wife doth partake with the Husband in all his goods; and he not onely dwelleth with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6901:30"/> vs, as the Husband with the Wife, but in vs, in our hearts, by faith, and by loue, and by his Spirit, in a farre more abſolute and perfect manner, then the Husband can with the Wife; Though this be an admirable ſimilitude, by which in a liuely manner is thus expreſſed the myſterie of that vnion betweene Chriſt and his Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this vnion is deſcribed by the ſimilitude of the head and the members of the body,<note place="margin">2.

And this vnion without queſtion is a ſubſtantiall, true, and reall vnion, without which, we cannot receiue the fruite of his Paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the gifts and graces of his Spirit: as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body cannot receiue their nouriſhment, and life, and motion, being ſeparated from the head; and in which we grow vp to perfection, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, common meate receiueth life and vertue of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him that eateth it; for a dead man that hath not life and heate in him, yea a ſicke man whoſe life and power of nature is ſo farre ſpent, that he cannot digeſt what he eateth, can receiue no life, nor ſtrength from his meate, it being but dead fleſh or the like; till it be as it were quickened and raiſed to life by the heate and vertue of the eater, it cannot nouriſh nor preſerue life in him. But it is not ſo with Chriſt our ſpirituall foode; he doth not receiue life from vs, but he rather giueth life vnto vs: and therefore S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> affirmes that for this reaſon,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Ambroſe lib. <hi>6.</hi> de ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt is that liuing bread that came downe from heauen. Ioh.</hi> 6.51. So that Chriſt remaineth in the eater, becauſe he is ſo vnited vnto him, that he cannot be corrupted, nor conuerted into the ſubſtance of him that eateth: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther changeth it into him (as I ſaid before:) and the eater remaineth in Chriſt, becauſe he receiueth life from him, whoſe blood is drinke indeede, and whoſe fleſh is meate indeede; not carnally to feede the body (as the fleſhly Capernaits and groſſe Papiſts doe imagine,<note place="margin">

Ioh. 6.55.</note>) but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to feede and nouriſh our ſoules and bodies to eternall life. For ſo Chriſt explaineth himſelfe, ſhewing (againſt his fleſhly hearers) how his ſpeech was to be vnderſtood,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6901:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> not after a carnall and fleſhly (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

Ioh.</hi> 6.63. And by this vnion alſo, you may ſee how our v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt is exemplified.</p>
            <p>Againe, Chriſt expreſſeth it in moſt liuely manner, by the compariſon of the vine and the branches. I am the Vine, ſaith Chriſt, and ye are the branches; as the branch cannot beare fruite of it ſelfe, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.4, 5. So that as there is a vnion betweene the vine &amp; the branches, ſo is there betweene Chriſt and his Church; and as the branches receiue the ſappe and life from the vine, ſo doe we from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">6.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6901:32"/> grafting it is not ſo, for it is neceſſarie that we who are the grafts, ſhould be turned into the nature of the ſtocke Chriſt Ieſus: that we may bring forth ſuch fruite as is anſwerable to his nature,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.75.</note> in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the daies of our life. Secondly, hence there is not to be imagined any confuſion, or transfuſion of Chriſt, or of his eſſentiall qualities into vs, (as may ſeeme to be of the ſtocke into the graft, and as the Libertines did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) but <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thus then you may ſee plainely, the veritie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of this vnion declared vnto you; If you conſider the manner and order of it, you ſhall finde it ſpirituall and ſupernaturall (as in part I have touched already.) It is a ſpirituall vnion;<note place="margin">Lanchius in Epheſ.</note> becauſe it is wrought by the Spirit, and by faith; by the ſpirit in reſpect of Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt worketh it by the ſpirit; and by faith in reſpect of vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe true faith working by loue, is as it were the bond and tie, by which the bleſſed ſpirit, doth as it were knit and Vnite vs to Chriſt. It is the Spirit that workes faith and all other graces in vs, and therefore queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he workes and effecteth this vnion, which is the fountaine and foundation of the reſt. <hi>All theſe worketh that one and the ſame Spirit, diuiding to euery one ſeuerally.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. We are made the ſpouſe of Chriſt, the members of Chriſt, and fleſh of his fleſh, by his ſpirit, by whom he doth incorporate himſelfe to vs, and vs vnto him.

Therefore whether Chriſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the word, or in the Sacraments, it is by his ſpirit and our faith, that he is vnited to vs, and we to him; and this not in a carnall but a ſpirituall manner; for the workes of the ſpirit are ſpirituall, and ſpiritually to bee vnderſtood. <hi>De naturali in nobis Chriſti veritate, quae dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, niſi ab eo diſcimus, ſtultè atque impiè dicimus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hilarie,</hi>

            <p>O then beloued, how are we bound to ſhew our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God, for this our moſt ioyfull and happy vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, ſince he hath made vs freely to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and engraffed vs into Chriſt! By faith wee ſhould ſtriue continually to liue like Chriſtians, like thoſe that haue a vnion and Communion with Chriſt. The Apoſtle in my Text doth deſcribe the ſtate and condition of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and yet he doth not ſay, if any man be a Chriſtian, he is a new creature, but, If any man be in Chriſt, to ſhew that <hi>Chriſtianum eſſe, eſt eſſe in Chriſto,</hi> to bee a Chriſtian,<note place="margin">Muſculus in Text.</note> is to be in Chriſt; and to be in Chriſt, is to liue the life of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6901:36"/> Chriſt, and to be made like to him, in whom we liue. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is without Chriſt, and doth not endeauour ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to liue the life of Chriſt, hee is no true Chriſtian, though he make an outward profesſion of Chriſtianity; it is an eaſie matter to be made partaker of the externall ſacraments and name of a Chriſtian, but not ſo eaſie thus to be in Chriſt; for this requireth newneſſe of life (as I ſhall ſhew at large in the next circumſtance.) If then thou wouldeſt know a Chriſtian, or know thy ſelfe to be in Chriſt, looke not to the externall and verball profeſsion, but ſearch into thy owne conſcience,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.5.6. M. Hooker Eccleſiaſt. policie, booke 5. pag. 306.</note> and looke to the reall and actuall life of a Chriſtian. No man actually is in Chriſt, but he in whom Chriſt is actually, and in whom the life of Chriſt, or of grace and newneſſe, from Chriſt doth appeare: he that hath not the ſonne, hath not life; and he that hath not life, the life of grace, wee may truely ſay, he hath not the ſonne. The bird is knowne by her ſinging, the tree is knowne by his fruits, and a Chriſtian is known by his life and conuerſation. He is pure by imputation of puritie from the merits of Chriſt; and he is pure by the grace of regeneration wrought in him by the holy and bleſſed ſpirit: for the perfection at which hee ſtriues and labours truely according to the meaſure of that grace which is giuen vnto him, and the effects of this purity, is like a burning lampe ſhining forth gloriouſly in all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; it is holineſſe it ſelfe, and not the name of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that makes a Chriſtian.

Chriſt was tempted (as I ſaid before) but temptations to him were but like ſparkes of fire falling vpon the waters, quickly quenched. But to vs they are like ſparkes falling vpon tinder, or dry row, quickly ſet on fire; and therefore we had neede to pray that our hearts may be wet with the dew of Grace, that we may the better reſiſt and ouercome them. And comfort thy ſelfe with this, that God (who is thy louing Father in Chriſt) hath the Deuill in chaines; and as hee ſtayeth the waues of the Sea at his pleaſure, <hi>Iob</hi> 38.8. ſo he holdeth Satan as with bit and bridle, that hee can tempt thee no otherwiſe, nor any longer then God ſeeth for thy good, as is euident by the example of <hi>Iob.</hi> Chap. 1.12.

Iohn 1.</p>
            <p>We muſt not then conclude, that becauſe we are ſubiect to temptations, or becauſe the ſeeds of ſin are ſtill in vs, and the corruption of our nature not fully purged, that therefore we are out of the fauour of God; (for theſe may be in Gods deareſt Saints.)

And labour earneſtly to reſiſt theſe temptations, and endure the combate with patience, hauing an eie to our Captain, Chriſt Ieſus, who is the Author and finiſher of our faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.2. And to ſtrengthen thy faith, and free thee from doubting the better, let me entreat thee to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that the ſtate of a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6901:52"/> Chriſtian in this life, is but like a man on the top of a <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Simil. </seg>1</label> tower; ſo long as he lookes vpwards, he ſtands ſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting, but if once he looke downe, his head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins preſently to bee giddy, and hee feares falling. So whiles we looke vp to Chriſt, and remember how God freely accepts vs as righteous in him, we are confident of our eſtate and of Gods mercy in Chriſt; but if wee caſt downe our eyes vpon our owne corruptions, our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith and holineſſe, then doubtings beginne to aſſault vs. We muſt not then ſeeke peace in our ſelues, but in Chriſt who is our peace,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.14.

But when he ſaw the waues comming againſt him, he preſently doubteth &amp; feareth drowning; begins to ſink, til finding himſelfe vnable to ſaue himſelfe, he flyeth to Chriſt, &amp; prayeth earneſtly to him for help, <hi>Maſter ſaue me, J periſh.</hi> And then Chriſt giueth him his hand, and bringing him into the ſhip, ſaueth them from drowning. And in like manner it is with a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; at firſt when Chriſt calleth him to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the preaching of the Goſpell, being perſwaded by the Spirit of God to beleeue, hee comes boldly vnto Chriſt, being moued by the excellency of Chriſts merit, and the free promiſes of grace and mercy in him; but when he once comes to ſee his vnthankefulneſſe, and the weakeneſſe of his faith and obedience; the vnbeliefe, and want of Sanctification in him: then (the waues of Satans temptations and corruptions of his owne nature aſſaulting him) feares and doubtings ſeaſe vpon him: and he is ready to ſinke downe into the Sea of deſpaire for want of Faith.</p>

The Sunne riſing is knowne by the light approching, the fire by the heate, the tree by the fruite, and ſo our Election by the effects and ſignes of it. If we go firſt to that vnſearchable depth of Gods ſecret counſell, to that moſt glorious Sunne of his wonderfull decree: (as Satan will moue vs to doe, hiding the effects and ſignes of his free grace from vs, that we may be confounded in the ſearch of the cauſe) how can we chuſe but be drowned with the depth, and haue the eyes of our weake faith, dazelled with that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable brightneſſe of the wiſedome and knowledge of God?

Thus did <hi>Iulian</hi> and other Apoſtates ſinne, and of theſe is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to be vnderſtood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>verſe</hi> 6. This ſinne, I ſay, thou canſt not fall into (beeing ingrafted into Chriſt by faith:) and for all other ſinnes, bee they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo grieuous, remiſsion is promiſed vpon faith and repentance; and that freely, not for the merit of thy faith or repentance, but for the merit of Chriſt. Why then ſhouldeſt thou not apply the generall promiſes of grace vnto thy ſelfe in particular? <hi>Come vnto me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>all ye that be weary and heauy leaden, and I will refreſh you:</hi> this promiſe is generall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. But thy owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will tell thee, that thou art weary and heauy loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the burden of thy ſinnes; and therefore thou mayeſt well conclude, that comming vnto Chriſt, the promiſe of mercy belongs to thee: <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall beleeue
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6901:56"/> and be baptized, ſhall be ſaued:</hi> this is a generall promiſe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. But thy owne conſcience will tell thee, that thou art baptized, and that thou beleeueſt (though it may be thy faith is but weake, but like a graine of muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeede (that is, very ſmall) <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.20.) yet if thou canſt but ſay with the man in the Goſpel, <hi>I beleeue, Lord helpe my vnbeleefe, Marke</hi> 9.24. If thou canſt but touch the hemne of Chriſts veſture with the finger of faith (if the hand of faith by which thou mayſt lay faſt hold on him be wanting;) yet by this touch of Chriſt euen with the finger of faith, the vertue of Chriſt may flow forth ſufficiently to ſtop the bloody iſſue of thy ſinnes, and to cure the maladies of thy ſoule; and with this thou mayeſt truly apply the promiſes of grace vnto thy ſelfe. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this then, ſince thou art, and muſt bee a ſouldier, while thou liueſt in the campe or field of the Church; faint not at the ſight of thy enemies, though they be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and terrible;<note place="margin">2.

In a word, thou haſt myriades of Angels to accompany thee, and the prayers of the Saints of the whole Church, yea of Chriſt himſelfe, at the right hand of his Father, like the ſhowting of the Iſraelites,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 6.20.</note> to make the walles of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo, the ſtrength of thy enemies to faile.

Yet this let me tell you, or thoſe whomſoeuer that defend their poſitions. <hi>Aliud eſt nouare, aliud renouare.</hi> It is one thing to make new, and another thing to renue that which was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Thoſe are ſaid to make new, who doe inſtitute and deuiſe ſuch things as haue neuer beene; and thoſe are ſaid to renue, who doe but reduce old things to their Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue perfection and integritie. Our religion is not a new but a renewed religion;<note place="margin">7. Our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not a new but a renewed Religion.</note> what was deformed, in the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Popery, is now reformed in the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: their falſe oldneſſe of ſuperſtition is baniſhed, and the true primitiue oldneſſe of Apoſtolike Doctrine reſtored. Bleſſed be God that their darke oldneſſe is paſſed, and that the true light hath ſhined amongſt vs. This newneſſe of truth, God of thy mercy keepe with vs: and keepe from vs that oldneſſe of errour for euermore; And let euery faithfull Chriſtian ſay, Amen. Much more I might ſay concerning this point. But I haſten to an end. And thoſe who deſire to be further ſatisfied herein, either of the new or renewed part, either Papiſts, or Proteſtants, who are the truly ancient Catholikes: I referre them to that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and worthy worke of a now Reuerend and learned Father of our Church,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. to the 30. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1.</note> who hath ſoundly and fully hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this queſtion. <hi>Old things are paſſed away, and behold all things are become new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one queſtion more, of which but a touch and I haue done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All things are become new.</hi> But when was it that all things did become new? or when is it that all things ſhold become new? If we ſpeak of the heauenly newnes of the Goſpel, it was at the comming of Chriſt vnto vs; when the Angel brought that glad tydings of the Goſpel, <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.10. Renewed againe, when the blacke clouds of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and ſuperſtitious darkeneſſe (eclypſing for a time the light of grace) thoſe thicke miſts of Egyptian Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an blindneſſe, aſcending from the valley of ignorance,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:6901:63"/> were baniſhed from vs, with the bright beames of truth. But if wee ſpeake of the ſpirituall newneſſe of the inner man, it is and muſt be at the comming of vs vnto Chriſt:<note place="margin">1. The time of our new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at our comming to Chriſt and Chriſt to vs.</note> no ſooner can we be in Chriſt, but preſently we are and muſt be new creatures, then this change is begunne, though not perfected in vs. There is no deferring, no procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, no poſting off till the morrow: we muſt not ſay with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in that his combate betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit, <hi>Ecce modò fiat, modò fiat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſtine lib, confeſs. <hi>8.</hi> cap. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> behold I will leaue my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure anon, anon; but let me ſtay a while: yet happie if we follow his example, and leaue it ſo ſoone: if we pray, and ſigh out with teares, as he doth in the chapter following, <hi>Quandiu, quandiu, cras, cras,</hi> How long Lord,<note place="margin">Auguſt. conf. lib. <hi>8.</hi> cap. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> how long to morrow, tomorrow? Why not euen now, euen this very houre ſhould I not obtaine this new creation? ſhould there not be an end of my ſinfull corruptions? O Lord giue vs this newnes, while it is called to day, leſt we be depriued of tomorrow; &amp; the day of death come vpon vs at vnawares.</p>
            <p>There are many in the world,<note place="margin">2. Deferring of repentance a dangerous ſinne.</note> that will deferre this change till the morrow; till they be old, or till the day of their death; and thinke that time to bee time enough, to waſh away their ſweete pleaſures of ſinne, with the bitter teares of repentance, that mend not their liues vntill their liues end; but theſe are like a man that carried a candle ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at his backe, and walketh in the darke to deſtruction. If the ſhippe be in danger by leaking, it is to be mended in the hauen, not to be deferred till it come to ſea; If the wall of a citie be broken down, it is to be builded in peace, and not to be left off till the time of warre. The ſouldier muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his weapon before the combate, otherwiſe, as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutarch Graet. Apothég.</note> reporteth of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that ſeeing a ſouldier prepare his dart in the battell, he baniſhed him from his armie, becauſe he was then a preparing, when hee ſhould haue beene a fighting; and ſuch may be the ſtate of all thoſe who prepare not to fight vnder the banner of Chriſt, till the day of Battell; who begin not to leade a new life, till their life begins to leaue them: for deferring their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vntill their ends, they oftentimes come to an end
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6901:64"/> without repentance; and if thou haſt beene forgetfull of God all thy life time, how canſt thou thinke that God wil be mindfull of thee at thy death? God ſometime takes a man away, and giueth him time and grace; ſometimes hee giueth him time, but not grace to repent: and ſometimes neither grace nor time. There is a terrible example of this related in the life of S. <hi>Thomas Moore:</hi>
               <note place="margin">In vita Thom. Moore. cap. <hi>32.</hi>
               </note> of a certaine prophane wrech, who liuing wickedly all his life, was wont ſhameleſly like an Atheiſt to boaſt, that he cared not for repentance, for he could bee ſaued with the ſaying of three words, though it were at the point of death. But marke his end; before he came to be old, riding poſt haſte ouer a broken bridge, his horſe ſtumbled, and not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſtay him, when he ſaw he muſt needs fall into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he let looſe the raines, and cryed out with this fearefull exclamation, <hi>Capiat omnia daemon,</hi> Horſe and man to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: and thus with his three words in ſtead of being ſaued (for ought wee know) hee went downe quicke into hell.</p>
            <p>Oh then beloued let vs not deferre and put off our new Creation, but labour truely for it while we haue time.<note place="margin">3. This new creation is to be ſought while we haue time.</note> The feaſt of dedication amongſt the Iewes was in the winter, when they did dedicate their new temple vnto God. It is now winter, and the time of the new yeare, oh then let vs likewiſe dedicate the new temples of our ſoules and bodies as a new-yeares-gift vnto him. Our Sauiour offers vnto vs the new Roabes of his righteouſneſſe, for a glorious new-yeares-gift. Let vs then put off our olde ragges of ſinne, as we put off our old cloathes, but let vs not put them on againe: for this new-yeares-gift of our new Creation, is a garment of great price, of excellent vertue, that muſt not be put off neither night nor day; for it is like a coat of male to defend our ſoules from all the poyſoned darts of ſinne and Satan.<note place="margin">4.

            </p>
            <p>It is related of <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, King of <hi>England,</hi> who after
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6901:64"/> his fathers death obtained the ſcepter, that he called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all his old familiars, with whom he had liued diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and giuing them ſome gifts, hee bound them vpon paine of their liues, that (except they became new men) they ſhould neuer come neere the Kings Court, leſt by their familiarity either he himſelfe might he corrupted, or hee might be drawne by them to corrupt iuſtice and iudgment: ſo carefull was that Princely Conuert to auoyde all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that might bring him backe vnto euill.</p>
            <p>And thus ſhould euery Chriſtian be watchfull to auoyde all enticements, that may withdraw his heart from Chriſt vnto ſinne, like that young man of whom S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Ambroſe lib. <hi>2.</hi> de poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. cap. <hi>10.</hi>
               </note> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention; that hauing been in loue with a harlot, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a ſtrange country, he left his wicked loue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a new man, and therefore at his returne home againe, meeting the harlot, he paſſed by her, as if he had not known her: but ſhe called to him in her wonted manner, <hi>Non noſti me,</hi> Haſt thou not knowne me, my loue? <hi>Ego ſum,</hi> it is I: to whom the young man anſwereth, <hi>At ego nom ſum ego,</hi> But I am not I, I am not as I was. I was not as I am, I am now become a new man, and therefore thy old enticements ſhal not preuaile againſt me. And bleſſed is the man that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this bleſſed change in himſelfe, that when thoſe three entizing harlots, the world, the fleſh, and the deuil, ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour againe to deceiue him, by alluring him to his wonted ſinnes, can anſwere with this young man, <hi>Ego non ſum ego,</hi> I am not I, I am now become a new creature, and therfore my oldneſſe is paſſed. I am free from the bondage of ſinne, and become the ſeruant of righteouſneſſe, that I may haue the fruit vnto holineſſe, and the end euerlaſting life.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.22. 5</note> O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, the day of our conuerſion, of our new Creation, is our new-yeares day,<note place="margin">The day of our new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion is our new yeares day.</note> to be celebrated with ioyfulneſſe for euer: and becauſe ſo long as we liue in our mortall bodies, we ſinne euery day (leſſe or more) againſt God, euery day ſhould be our new-yeares day, wherein we ſhould dedicate our ſelues,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.2.</note> our ſoules and bodies as a new-yeares-gift vnto God. Wherfore as merchants &amp; tradeſmen vſe euery yeare to caſt vp their accounts, to ſee what they haue gained, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6901:65"/> what they haue loſt: ſo let vs euery yeare, nay euery month, euery weeke, yea euery day caſt vp our ſpirituall account, and ſee what we haue gained, or what we haue loſt; how far we haue gone forward, or how backwards in perfecting the worke of our new Creation. And as the crowing of the cocke did put <hi>Peter</hi> in mind of his new conuerſion, ſo let the returne of the yeare, the crowing of the cocke, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sunne, and the ſtriking of the clocke, put vs in remebrance of our new Creation, ſo that euery yeare, euery day, euery houre, we may ſtriue and labour to be new men in Chriſt, wholly conformed to the image of our Sauiour.
